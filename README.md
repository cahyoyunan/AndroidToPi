# AndroidToPi
Something called IoT for Beginner.

All do it by Myself on android 4.4 and JDK 6 , and using Eclipse for android.
You must ask me why I using eclipse instead of android studio ? Because I did this on early 2016 and that time the android studio not really stable (for my potato laptop xD).


Basically on this project I can turn on/off the GPIO board that connect the relay so you can switch off/on the electronic devices.
The connection between the smartphone and the raspberry, I using 2 type of connection
1.Bluetooth
2.TCP/IP

For the bluetooth I using module bluetooth that I can buy on local electronic IoT hobbies (I forgot what the type of the bluetooth model)
Then the TCP/IP connection, you can connect using either Wifi connection or Internet . Raspberry attached to Wifi dongle that can be mini hotspot or connect usual wifi router.
Especially for Internet connection, raspberry connect to IP Public that I have on cloud. So you can't do the Internet remote without have any cloud service or Ip public.
But the alternative maybe you can use the service from website like noip.com or ddns.com


There is many feature that actually can be explore more, maybe you can.
